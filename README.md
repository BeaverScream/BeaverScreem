## 🌟 Featured Projects

These projects demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and deploy complex applications using industry-relevant technologies.

### 1️⃣ SmartChef: LLM-Powered Recipe Recommender (ML/Full-Stack) **[[Repo Link]](https://github.com/BeaverScream/SmartChef)**

Built an intelligent recipe recommendation engine that translates user's natural language queries into **sentence embeddings**.

* **ML Architecture:** Used the **`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** model to generate embeddings and utilized **FAISS vector indexing** for lightning-fast semantic search against a 6,000-recipe corpus.
* **Full-Stack:** Designed the pipeline from data cleaning to a responsive **React/Vite** frontend and a dedicated **Flask API** backend.
* **Technologies:** Python, Flask, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, React.

### 2️⃣ UBC Campus Explorer (Software Architecture/Full-Stack) **[[Public Readme Link]](https://github.com/BeaverScream/UBC-Campus-Explorer-README)** (Code private due to academic policy)

Engineered a full-stack system in **TypeScript** (React/Express) to ingest, query, and dynamically visualize complex campus room and building data on an interactive map.

* **Architecture & Design:** Implemented a robust, layered architecture applying principles like **Facade** and **Strategy patterns** alongside a custom **Query Validation/Execution Engine**.
* **Quality:** Demonstrated rigorous development practices through comprehensive **Unit/Integration Testing** (Mocha/Chai), directly applying principles learned from system validation experience.
* **Technologies:** TypeScript, React, Express/Node.js, Leaflet, Mocha/Chai.

### 3️⃣ Space Game Database Demo (Advanced SQL/Backend) **[[Repo Link]](https://github.com/BeaverScream/Space_resource_management_game_demo)**

Designed, modeled, and containerized the core **PostgreSQL** database and API for a persistent, multiplayer space simulation game.

* **Database Design:** Implemented a complex relational schema 

 and enforced data integrity using Foreign Keys, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL constraints.
* **Advanced SQL:** Executed all 10 required database operations, including complex **DIVISION** and **NESTED AGGREGATIONS** to support challenging game logic and reporting.
* **System:** Managed the full data lifecycle from schema design to secure **Authentication**.
* **Technologies:** PostgreSQL, Node.js/Express.

### 4️⃣ SpendingTracker (Data Utility/Backend) **[[Repo Link]](https://github.com/BeaverScream/SpendingTracker)**

Developed a practical Python/Flask utility that automates monthly financial **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** for household budgeting.

* **Data Processing:** The tool cleans, standardizes, and securely uploads multi-bank CSV transaction data to Google Sheets via the **Service Account API**.
* **Utility:** Provides a reliable, automated solution used monthly to enforce consistency and categorization across different banking formats.
* **Technologies:** Python, Flask, Google Sheets API.

### 5️⃣ ExpenseLedger (Java Desktop Application) **[[Repo Link]](https://github.com/BeaverScream/ExpenseLedger)**

A standalone desktop application built in Java to record, manage, and summarize personal expense items across multiple user-defined ledger pages.

* **OOP & Persistence:** Utilized **Java's OOP principles** to model the Ledger Page/Expense Item hierarchy and implemented robust **File I/O** for saving and loading the entire application state.
* **Data Summarization:** Provided essential **spending summaries** (total amount, max spending, spending per category) to help users review habits, demonstrating data processing skills.
* **[Repo Link]**
* **Technologies:** Java, Java GUI, File I/O.
